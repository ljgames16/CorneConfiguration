 This is my corne keyboard configuration. Its my first time building a corne keyboard which I bought the parts form  https://typeractive.xyz/pages/build. I created a this repository to which a copied the template from https://github.com/typeractivexyz/corne-wireless-view-zmk-config. Then I configured it to my liking. Below is the keymap of my keyboard.
